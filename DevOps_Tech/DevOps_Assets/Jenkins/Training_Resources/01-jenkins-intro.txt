jenkins master-slave architecture:
--------------------------------------
1. when work is there, master calls agent and ask them to do work
2. daily agent comes to master and ask if there is any work


1)in agent need to install java,
2)in master go to manage jenkins, nodes and add agent and fill the details.
3)in worker node a workspace folder will be creted automatically which defined in master node.

WebHook:
---------
in github:
settings -> webhook -> URL -> jenkins-url/github-webhook/
In jenkins pipline:
job -> build triggers -> github hook trigger

Jenkins- Pipeline Synatx:
---------------
pipeline{
	agent{

	}
	environment{

	}
	parameters{
	
	}
	stages{
		stage('Build'){
			steps{
